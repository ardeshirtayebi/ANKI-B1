# German Vocabulary for Beginners and Intermediate Learners (A1-B1)
This project consists of an Excel file containing more than 2,600 essential German vocabulary words, ranging from levels A1 to B1, designed for learning through the Anki application. The primary source for the vocabulary used in this database was extracted from an Anki deck that is, unfortunately, no longer available (or at least I can't find it. If you have the link, please send it to me).

## About the Project

The words from the original deck have been extracted and optimized for better learning efficiency. To achieve this, I enlisted the help of GPT-4 to translate each word into English and Persian (my native language). This deck is still a work in progress, and currently, I am focusing on the following enhancements:

- Adding Audio Pronunciations: Incorporating audio files for the pronunciation of each German word, extracted from the reputable Duden dictionary.
- Including Sample Sentences: Adding at least one practical, simple, and everyday sentence in German using the relevant word.
- Translations: Providing translations of these sentences in both English and Persian.
- Categorization: Organizing each word based on a specific category or theme to facilitate learning.

## Project Goals

Ultimately, this deck aims to feature:

- Comprehensive Vocabulary Range: From A1 to B1 levels, covering essential vocabulary for beginners and intermediate learners.
- Multi-language Support: Each entry offers translations in both English and Persian, catering to a wider range of learners.
- Contextual Learning: With sample sentences in German and their translations in English and Persian, learners can grasp the usage of words in real-world contexts.
- Categorization: The 'Tag' column enables users to filter and study words based on specific categories or themes.

Additionally, through regular use of the Anki application and throughout my personal learning process, I'm adding a final polish to each card to enhance its quality.
